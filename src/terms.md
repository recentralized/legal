PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW) ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS.  PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT FUTURE CHANGES TO THESE TERMS, LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND AN AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE DISPUTES BY ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF BY A COURT PROCEEDING.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.

# Terms of Use

Effective date:  February 20, 2019

Welcome to Recentralized!  Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”).  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at {{.ContactEmail}}.

These Terms of Use (the **“Terms”**) are a binding contract between you and Recentralized Corporation (**“Recentralized,”** **“we”** and **“us”**). These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the [Privacy Policy]({{.PrivacyPolicyURL}}) and [Cookie Policy]({{.CookiePolicyURL}}).

You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and your parent or guardian has agreed to these Terms on your behalf).  If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).

You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services.  Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services.

## Will the Services ever change?

We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.

## Will these Terms ever change?

These Terms may need to change along with the Services.  We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on Recentralized’s website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services.  If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

### What about my privacy?

Recentralized takes the privacy of its users very seriously.  For the current Recentralized Privacy Policy, please [click here]({{.PrivacyPolicyURL}}).

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (**“COPPA”**) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13.  We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us.  If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.  If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at {{.ContactEmail}}.

## How do I access and use the Services?

You may access the Services by visiting www.recentralized.org and/or by using any software that utilizes our Services.  Also, in order to use the Services, you may be required to sign up for an account and select a password and user name (“Account Credentials”) and provide profile information such as your email address.

You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself.  You may not create an account, select Account Credentials, or otherwise use the Services using any name, information, account or Account Credentials that you do not have a right to use, or using another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person.  You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission. You will not share your account or Account Credentials with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your Account Credentials. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.

## Are there any restrictions on my use of the Services?

Yes. Your use of the Services must comply with all of these Terms, including the following restrictions:

You will only use the Services for your own personal, non-commercial use (except as explicitly permitted in these Terms as an intended use of the Services), and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you.  If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services.  We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.

You understand that Recentralized owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce, create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.

The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the **“Content”**) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws.  You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell, commercialize or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including Recentralized’s) rights.

The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!

## Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional restrictions:

You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any Content or User Submission (each of those terms is defined below) or otherwise use the Services or interact with the Services in a manner that:

1. Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including Recentralized);
1. Violates any law or regulation, including, without limitation, any applicable export control laws;
1. Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;
1. Jeopardizes the security of your Recentralized account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you);
1. Attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other user;
1. Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes;
1. Runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure);
1. “Crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content (through use of manual or automated means);
1. Copies or stores any significant portion of the Content (except any Content you own);
1. Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services.

A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.

Finally, you understand and agree that although Recentralized has no obligation to monitor the Content on the Services, it may choose to do so, and that Recentralized may take down, remove, or suspend any Services related to any Content (including User Submissions) at any time, for any reason.

## Do I have to grant any licenses to Recentralized?

Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your **“User Submission.”**  In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions.  Please note the following licenses are subject to our [Privacy Policy]({{.PrivacyPolicyURL}}) to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally identifiable information.

For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Recentralized a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes – for example, making sure your content is viewable on a mobile device as well as a computer) distribute, reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services.

If you store a User Submission in your own personal Recentralized account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant Recentralized the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.

In addition, if you provide us with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services (whether through a direct email or otherwise) (“Feedback”), then you grant Recentralized a license to freely use, modify, copy, and distribute such Feedback for any purpose.

All of the above are licenses only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.  You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicensable, transferable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you delete your Recentralized account, you understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from Recentralized’s records.  Finally, you understand and agree that Recentralized, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.

## Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?

Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it.   We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.  We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.

You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it.  You will keep all your registration information accurate and current.  You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.

**The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by or affiliated with Recentralized.  When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Recentralized is not responsible for such risks.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.**

**Recentralized has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services.  In addition, Recentralized will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service.  By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.**

Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals.  You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.  You agree that Recentralized shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.

If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that Recentralized is under no obligation to become involved.  In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Recentralized, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services.  If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”

## Do the Services cost anything?

Our Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future.  We will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.

## What if I want to stop using the Services?

You’re free to do that at any time, by using the “Delete Account” feature in your account; please refer to our [Privacy Policy]({{.PrivacyPolicyURL}}), as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.

Recentralized is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.   Recentralized has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.

Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.  We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Recentralized.

Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.  By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.

## What else do I need to know?

*Warranty Disclaimer.*  Neither Recentralized nor its licensors or suppliers make any representations or warranties concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services.  We (and our licensors and suppliers) make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through the Services.  THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY RECENTRALIZED (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR  A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

*Limitation of Liability.*  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL RECENTRALIZED (OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) $100 OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO RECENTRALIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (III) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

*Indemnity.*  To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Recentralized, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.  In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).

*Assignment.*  You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Recentralized’s prior written consent.  We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.

*Choice of Law.*  These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.  Any claims or disputes that are not subject to arbitration as set forth below will be brought exclusively in the state and/or federal courts located in [San Francisco County, California].

*Arbitration.*  **Please read the following ARBITRATION PROVISION carefully. it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Recentralized and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.  Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND RECENTRALIZED ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.**

* *Arbitration Rules;* Applicability of Arbitration Provision.  Any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in [San Francisco, California].  The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, which arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.  The existence and content of the dispute, the arbitral proceedings and any rulings or award shall be kept strictly confidential except that either party may disclose such information (i) to the extent that disclosure may be required of a party to fulfill a legal duty or right, (ii) to enforce or challenge an award in a bona fide legal proceeding as authorized herein, and/or (iii) to such party’s professional advisors, provided such advisors are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those set forth herein.  In addition, Recentralized may disclose such information to Recentralized’s current and potential investors who have been advised of the confidential nature of such information.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any and all available remedies, whether provisional or final, legal or equitable, including conservatory relief and injunctive relief.  Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  This provision does not preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction.  
* *Costs of Arbitration.* The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Recentralized will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Recentralized will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. 
* *Small Claims Court.*  Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate disputes set forth in subsection (a), you or Recentralized may assert damages claims in small claims court in any United States jurisdiction where you access the Services, solely to the extent such claims satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of the selected small claims court. 
* *Waiver of Jury Trial.* **YOU AND RECENTRALIZED WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.  You and Recentralized are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.  In any litigation between you and Recentralized over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND RECENTRALIZED WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.**
* *Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.*  **ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.  CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY.**
* *Opt-out.*  You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out either by email at {{.ContactEmail}} or by mail, postmarked within 30 days of first accepting these Terms to the following address:  [insert mailing address].  Your notice (whether submitted via email or via mail) must include (1) your name and residence address; (2) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration provision.
* *Third Party Beneficiaries.* Both you and Recentralized acknowledge and agree Recentralized’s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.

*Miscellaneous.*  You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Recentralized may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.  The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.  If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  You and Recentralized agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Recentralized, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms,.  You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Recentralized, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Recentralized in any respect whatsoever.  Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding arbitration, you and Recentralized agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
