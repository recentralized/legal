This repo contains the public legal policies for Recentralized services. You can find the latest version of each policy document in the [policies directory](./policies).

## Versioning

We'll mark [each change to these documents](https://github.com/recentralized/legal/releases) with a git tag. In the
spirit of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org):

* Changes that require user notification will increment the major version. 
* Changes that incorporate new information but do not require notification will
  increment the minor version.
* Changes that fix an error will increment the patch version.

Changes to the tooling will not be versioned.
